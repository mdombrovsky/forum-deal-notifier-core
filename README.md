## Q&A

### Don't like how the queries work?

I don't blame you they were created years ago for the purpose of being easy to visualize, not parse text well.

Want something more useful like regex support? No worries, you can just implement the Query interface and create it.

### Want more notification options?

Implement the Notifier and NotifierCredentials classes, with your favourite notification service, such as Discord.

### Your favourite website does not support RSS, or supports it badly?

Just implement the Scraper interface, a good example of that is the RedditJSONScraper
